Description
-----------
Models can manage states and features which can be used to simulate components behaviors.

Example
-------
This example explains how to manage states and features within models.

The model named 'model_states' has a state 'steps' which is updated (+1) every 0.5 second.
The model named 'model_features' has a state 'uptime' which is updated (+1) every second.
The models have also internal data ('steps_x10' and 'time_x2') that are updated at the same time.

A log is performed at each update of the state and feature.

To run the example just execute the following commands :
Note : K2 environment shall be set.

> make
> ./tu
